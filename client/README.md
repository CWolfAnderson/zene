`yarn run build`/`npm run build` to build prod bundle, it includes both treeshaking and uglify to optimize the code as much as possible.

`yarn test`/`npm test` run the tests with Jest and Enzyme, by default the test included only check for the correct render of base components & routes, all are passing.


## Project structure

The boilerplate structure and files are the same as this repo minus the *bin* folder, everything else is exactly the same.

## Tests

The testing environment is written in Jest and Enzyme.
The included tests are very basic and only check the proper render of base components + routes, there are no snapshot tests, I did not feel they were needed being the components really basic, at the first change they would need to be updated, imho setting the wrong approach of _"hey tests are broken, let's regenerate snapshots again"_.
While still basic, the default tests are easy to manage and expand, providing a smoother curve into testing with JavaScript and React.


## Eslint

This project uses AirBnB Javascript specs so you can write error-free react and javasctipt code, if you use Visual Studio Code, you can install eslint from the extension tab to activate this function, other editors just google _name of the editor + eslint_ you will find how to enable it for your editor.
